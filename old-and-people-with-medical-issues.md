  (both present and past). This guide outlines extra precautions to be taken.

# Old People and People with Medical Issues

People above 70 years of age and people with medical issues either currently or previously are at the most risk from COVID-19. This data shows the elderly are at a much greater risk than young people.

| Age Group | Mortality Rate % |
| :--- | ---: |
| 80 + | 14.8 % |
| 70 - 79 | 8 % |
| 50 - 59 | 1.3% |
| 40 - | &lt; 0.5 % |

With the available data there are no reported deaths of children under 10 years of age, and children seem to have a very low mortality rate from COVID-19.

The people with preexisting medical conditions tell a similar story. People with underlying medical conditions are at a greater risk than people without any predisposed medical condition. \([source](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-preexisting-health-conditions)\)

| Medical Condition | Mortality Rate % |
| :--- | ---: |
| Cardiovascular Disease | 10.5 % |
| Diabetes | 7.3 % |
| Chronic Respiratory Disease | 6.3 % |
| Hypertension | 6.0 % |
| Cancer | 5.6 % |
| No Health Condition | 0.9 % |

This all indicates that if you belong to any of the above said category you are at **High Risk** from COVID-19. You will need to take special precautions.

## Extra Precautions for People at Higher Risk

The above said people in the high risk category should follow these extra precautions to the ones specified in the guide.

1. Stock up on groceries and home supplies to avoid grocery visits and/or orders.
2. Take extra care to maintain safe distance \(1 metre ideally\) from others
3. When out in public on an absolutely necessary errand, limit contact and wash your hands often.
4. Avoid crowds as much as possible
5. Avoid all non essential intercity travels

### Supplies

3. Have enough household items on groceries on hand to avoid unnecessary outside contact
