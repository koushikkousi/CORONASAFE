# Centers to Test for COVID-19

_**A swab test:**_ A sample from your throat or nose will be collected with the help of a cotton swab.

_**A nasal aspirate:**_ In this method, the lab technician will inject a saline solution into your nose, and then remove the sample with a gentle suction.

_**A tracheal aspirate:**_ A thin, lighted tube called a bronchoscope is inserted into your lungs, from where a sample is collected for testing.

_**A sputum test:**_ Sputum can be collected either from the nose with a swab or by asking the patient to cough up the mucus.

_**A blood test:**_ Blood sample is drawn and tested in a lab for the virus. This is either done through a blanket test for all variants of the coronavirus \(including regular flu\) or through a specialised gene-sequencing test that locates the marker for the novel coronavirus.
