# Precautions and Preventive Measures

Even though COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, taking adequate precautions can help prevent you from being infected.

The virus spread through small droplets from the nose or mouth of the affected person, when the person sneezes or coughs. These droplets can travel more than 1 meter from the source and might land on objects and surfaces. Other people can catch the virus by touching the surface and then touching their eyes, mouth or nose. The virus can also be caught by inhaling these droplets if the distance between the affected person is less than one meter.

## Preventive Measures

There is no data showing that the virus can be transmitted through air. Hence, follow these steps to protect yourselves and the ones around you.

### Washing your hands frequently

Since transmission mainly occurs through your hands, you should wash them frequently and thoroughly. It is recommended to use soap and water when available, else **use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol and rub until it dries.**

> **Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for atleast 20 seconds or an alcohol based hand sanitizer.**

### Avoid Touching Your Eyes, Nose and Mouth

The virus can come in contact with your skin at any time, particularly your hands. If the contaminated skin touched your eyes, nose or mouth the virus can be transferred into your body thereby infecting you.

> **Don't touch your face without washing your hands first.**

### **Maintain Distance**

Depending on the level of outbreak in your local community it is [advised ](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)to keep a safe distance of at-least 1 meter \(&gt; 3 feet\) from anyone who is coughing or sneezing. If you are in the vicinity when the person sneezes or coughs they can produce small droplets which you can inhale and become infected if the person is infected.

### Cover Your Mouth and Nose while Sneezing or Coughing

If you are coughing or sneezing do so while covering your face with a bent elbow or a hand kerchief. This would help prevent the spread viruses such as Flu, Cold or COVID-19.
